I would like to develop an online electronic brochure and promotional poster application. The goal is to dynamically create brochures on a canvas interface. While creating a brochure, users will be able to select existing products and place them onto brochure pages dynamically. Product prices and discounts will be automatically inserted into the brochure. Brochure templates will be available for selection, and label/tag templates can also be created and selected. All elements will be fully dynamic — including product sizes, label text fonts, colors, template layouts, etc.

The created brochure campaign will be viewable and editable under a “Campaigns” page. Generated brochures can be shared as advertisements or posts on Instagram and/or Facebook, allowing users to run ads directly. Campaign start and end dates can be configured and displayed on the brochure, and date formats/layouts will also be template-driven.

The application will be named e-Brochure.

Website Features
Authentication & Registration

Login Page
Users must provide email, password, and captcha token. After validation, TOTP-based 2FA will be required.
If logging in for the first time, a TOTP key and QR code will be generated; after verification, the user may access the system.

Register Page
Required fields: email, first name, last name, and mobile phone number.
Captcha validation is mandatory.
After successful registration, an activation email will be sent. The account becomes active once the activation link is clicked.

Reset Password Page
Users must enter their email address and captcha.
Regardless of whether the email exists, the system will display:
“If this email exists in our system, a password reset email has been sent.”
The password-reset link will be valid for 3 hours. After 3 hours, the link becomes invalid.

Subscription Packages

After login, users will see subscription package options:

Monthly plan — €300

6-month plan — €250/month (discounted)

12-month plan — €200/month (discounted)

Users must choose one of these plans and proceed to the payment page.

Payment Method:
The system will integrate with iyzico as the payment gateway.
A configuration page accessible only to Super Admin will allow management of iyzico API parameters.

Architecture

The application will operate on a multitenant architecture.

There will be three user roles:

Super Admin – full access, can manage system-wide configurations, view/manage all tenants, and switch between tenants.

Tenant Admin

Tenant User

Products Page

All products will be listed.

Tenants can manually add products; these products will only be visible to their own tenant.

Global and tenant-level product filters will be available.

Super Admin will configure an API endpoint (cURL request) for fetching product data (names, categories, images).
This sync can run on a scheduled basis or be triggered manually.
Fetched product data will be saved to the database and shown on the Products page.

Tenant User Management

Tenant Admins can manage users within their own tenant (add/remove/update users).

Localization

The application will support multiple languages:

Turkish

English

German

Dashboard

A standard dashboard will display:

Total campaign count

Active campaign count

Time-based campaign statistics (graphs)

Product usage statistics within campaigns

Other analytical insights

Template (Şablon) Management

Accessible by different roles with different permissions.

Template Types:

Multi-page Templates
Attributes: Template Title, Cover Page, Inner Page, Back Page, Price Template, Font, Text Color, etc.

Single-page Templates

Each tenant can access and customize only their own templates.

Database & Security

All application data will be stored in PostgreSQL.

Authentication will be handled via local database.

Passwords and all sensitive data will be stored encrypted.
